# Koruza power module

The Koruza power module is power supply PCB for the Koruza PRO unit. It converts 25 VDC input from PoE to 5 V for logic part and 9 V for [koruza-move-driver](link1_koruza-move-driver). On the picture below is the 3D model of the board, placed on the [koruza-CM-board](link2_koruza_cm_board). For more details please check the [PDF schematics](link3_pdf-schematics) and [Issues section](link4_issues) if the repository.
